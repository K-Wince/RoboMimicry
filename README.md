# RoboMimicry
## Overview
#### Description
This project was created as a team in Maker Engineering class at Ohio Northern University. This controller utilizes a scaled down version of the main robotic arm to both control and motion map the robot using wireless communication. This allows for a better spatial representation of the robot for the programmar, as well as an ability to program it from farther away.
  
This won the 2023 IEEE ONU Student Branch Most Innovative Award - 1st Place.
#### Problem Statement
There is a need in smaller companies within the industrial field for a robotic arm controller that is easy to program motion plannings and routines of the robotic arm.

## Components
### Main Design
Both a controller and a robotic arm was constructed for this project. They are both controlled by an ESP32 that communicates with eachother wirelessly over the ESP-NOW protocol. This allows for the systems to be completely independent of each other and have a considerable range of communication.  

  We utilized potentiometers to measure the angles of each joint of the scaled version in order to see what position each joint is in.
